	"description": "EuroGeographics (sometimes known as GISCO) partners with Eurostat and the European Commission to distrbute NUTS statistical data joined with geographical boundary polygon data. However, EuroGeographics restricts this usage to non-commercial, so this source is used for concordance values only. EuroGeographics also offers other commercial data products, and some open data with a coarser resolution 1:1,000,000 scale in their EuroGlobalMap project (which is aggregated by both Quattroshapes and Mesoshapes). The term NUTS comes from the French acronym of 'Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics'.",
